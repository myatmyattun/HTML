<img width="300px" height="400px" src="Mulan.jpg" alt="Mulan">
<p style="color: red;">Scholarly consensus is that Mulan is a fictional character, probably developed in Northern China in response to the greater independence women enjoyed there, whose legend was then revised in succeeding eras to reflect the values and challenges of the times.

<p style="color: palevioletred;">ing is a great movie with a well developed plot and an outstanding voice cast. It is a simple, sweet film that the whole family can enjoy as we are taken in to a world of talking animals as they compete in a singing competition. There are countless fantastic covers performed by the animals throughout, a version of My Way by Frank Sinatra particularly stood out for me.

<p style="color: black;">However, the story feels a little underdeveloped. While there are some magical and emotional moments, it seems as if they didn't know how to end the movie. The lack of a strong villain also makes this movie a little less compelling. Nevertheless, the music is fun, and we enjoyed watching Encanto together as a family.
